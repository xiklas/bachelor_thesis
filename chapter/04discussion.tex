\label{ch:04discussion}

Our study aimed to investigate the impact of qualitative geographic context on the navigation performance of LLMs.
We hypothesized that our approach would significantly improve the ability of LLMs to provide accurate navigation instructions.
In order to validate our hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments by means of the methods described in chapter 2.
The results of these experiments presented in chapter 3 serve as the basis for the following discussion.

\section{Interpretation of Results}

Our experiments revealed that the inclusion of qualitative geographic context had a positive effect on LLM navigation performance.
The overall success rate increased from 20\% in the control group to 80\& in the test group.
This is a significant improvement in task success rate, which can be backed by further statistical analysis as presented towards the end of chapter 3.
Thus, our experiments clearly support our initial research hypothesis.
Concequently, the alternative hypothesis stating that additional qualitative geographic context does not significantly improve LLM navigation performance may be rejected.

To ensure we didn't get lucky with a specific city or model combination, we analyzed multiple cities and LLMs.
Across all of the tested combinations, we observed similar levels of improvement.
This leads us to believe that there may be a generalizable effect of qualitative geographic context on LLM navigation performance, as long as the models possess sufficient reasoning capabilities, which may be needed to process the additional context effectively.
Although we tested nine different combinations in total, and saw improvements across all of them, it is important to state that this is just a small fraction of the possible combinations of cities and LLMs that exist.
It is always possible that other cities or models could lead to drastically different results, even though our findings look promising.
