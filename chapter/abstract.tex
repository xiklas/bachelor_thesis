\section*{Abstract}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for various everyday tasks.
While navigation is a common task, little research has been done on LLM navigation performance in real-world scenarios such as urban navigation.
Additionally, there is no research on the effects of qualitative geographic context on LLM performance in this domain.
In this thesis, we aim to provide insights into these areas by evaluating the navigation performance of three LLMs in a A/B-testing setup across two geographical contexts.
Our experiments include a RAG-like approach, which enables us to provide LLMs with qualitative geographic context in the form of symbolic dipole relations.
Our results indicate that LLM performance in urban navigation tasks is severely limited.
However, using our method we were able to produce a significant performance increase of 62.5\%, suggesting that improving LLM navigation performance through qualitative geographic context is possible.
In addition to these results, we discuss the potential of navigation-specific LLM benchmarking as well as implications for practical applications and future academic research.
