To test our research hypothesis, we designed a series of experiments involving large language models confronted with navigation tasks.
Our approach can be broken down into the data used, the configuration of the LLMs - including the context enrichtment setup -, and ultimately the procedures used to conduct the experiments.
To make statements about the significance of the results, we also define the necessary metrics and statistical methods used for the subsequent evaluation.
